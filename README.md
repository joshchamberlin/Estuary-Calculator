# Estuary Calculator

The Estuary Calculator is an R-Shiny application designed to estimate the habitat valuation of estuarine environments for salmonids. This tool helps researchers, conservationists, policymakers, and builders assess the ecological and economic value of estuarine habitats in supporting salmon populations.

This repository is a R Shiny prototype of the user interphase for the Estuary Calculator. It is a draft product.

The documentation for this project is in the [google shared drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lmUKHCXn-VdrbKc_ow6PzDQd9Xl5_C9y) .

The prototype app has been deployed on the [NOAA test connect site](https://test-connect.fisheries.noaa.gov/content/0fb2622a-b5a9-4401-b098-38e967a813a7)
